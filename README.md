## About The Project

WebSocket Server is a robust tool designed to supercharge your project's WebSocket server using socket.io and redis. It's the perfect choice for developers who need to manage real-time, bi-directional communication between client and server.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
- Efficiently manage real-time communication.
- Listen to events emitted by the publish_realtime() function.
- Listen to events emitted by the client.

ðŸ›  Built With:
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

This project is ideal for developers looking to enhance communication capabilities in their projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An existing project where you need to manage real-time communication.
- An unused port number.

### Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/websocket_server.git
```
Then, to add WebSocket Server to your project, use the following command:

```bash
$ bench get-app https://github.com/empress-eco/websocket_server.git
```
Next, add "fsocketio_port" key in your common_site_config.json file and set the value to an unused port number:

```json
{
  ...,
  "fsocketio_port": 9002
}
```
Add the following line in your Procfile:

```bash
fsocket_server: /usr/bin/node apps/fsocket/socketio.js
```
Running "bench start" will automatically launch a socket io server.

## Usage

WebSocket Server is easy to use. Once installed, it will automatically listen to the events emitted by the publish_realtime() function and the client. This makes managing real-time communication in your project a breeze.
